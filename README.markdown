# lowryduda generator

This is a static site generator specialized for the creation of my professional
webpage. The pages are created from markdown files in `markdown/` according to a
certain schema of described in `schema.py`.


# Licensing information

The static site code here (all .py files) is made available under the MIT
License. A copy of this license is included in the repository.

The CSS has been adapted from the hyde and poole themes, originally written for
jekyll. I have never used jekyll, but they look nice. The author was kind enough
to make them available under MIT. See the headers at the top of those files for
more information on their licensing.

The individual content within the markdown and html files is not code or
documentation and is not licensed for use. All markdown and html files are
copyright David Lowry-Duda, 2020, all rights reserved. (But no one would want
anything there, so this is not a burden).
